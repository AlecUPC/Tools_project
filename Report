# Introduction

## Settings software

**In our analysis we used this version of Rstudio :**
RStudio 2021.09.0+351 "Ghost Orchid" Release (077589bcad3467ae79f318afe8641a1899a51606, 2021-09-20) for Windows
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.12.8 Chrome/69.0.3497.128 Safari/537.36

And then we used these 4 packages on Rstudio:

```{r packages, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
```

## Data description

In this case we have 1 dataset called **dataset.csv**.
This dataset has this number of observations and variables
:
```{r dimension, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
dataset<-read.csv("dataset.csv",sep=";")
dim(dataset)
```

We have 1506 observations and 36 variables.
These variables are characters (marital status, Job role...) and numerics (job satisfaction, performance rating...).

## Data cleaning

In order to analyze this dataset we need to clean it. In fact we can have some empty cells, collumn or rows. But we can also have mistake in some values for example different way to write a word (female/Female). These mistakes could be annoying in our analysis.

First of all, I used these functions:

```{r data_cleaning, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
dataset<-drop_na(dataset)
dataset<-clean_names(dataset)
dataset<-rename(dataset, age=i_age)
```

The **drop_na** functions allows us to delete every lines with "NA" inside the cells. After that the **clean_names** function corrects column titles to a standard format (no capital letters etc...). And then we used **rename** function to rename the *i_age* column to *age* column.

Then we noticed during our first analysis that some values
are inconsistent (.i.e: age in a company > 80 years old
etc...). So we decided to clean also these columns. But
also in order to make the dataset more readable we have
removed columns that we believe are useless, contain the
same data for everyone or contain personal information:

```{r first cleaning, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
#Clean age
dataset<-subset(dataset,age<80)
dataset<-subset(dataset,age>17)

#Clean and delete over18 (useless column)
dataset$over18<-NULL

#Clean employees_count + employees_number (useless and sensible data)
dataset$employee_count<-NULL
dataset$employee_number<-NULL

#Clean marital status (private and useless for our analysis)
dataset$marital_status<-NULL

#Clean standard hours (same standard for every people)
dataset$standard_hours<-NULL

#Clean job
dataset<-subset(dataset, department!="")
```

Once we have cleaned up most of the columns, we also check
that all the data in a column is in the same format (.i.e.
in the gender column, or in the city column). This could
prove cumbersome if we left these columns with different
formats (analysis problems etc.):

```{r second cleaning,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
#Clean the city and gender names
dataset$city<-ifelse(dataset$city=="Barcelone","Barcelona",dataset$city)
dataset$city<-ifelse(dataset$city=="Londres","London",dataset$city)
dataset$gender<-ifelse(dataset$gender=="female","Female",dataset$gender)
dataset$gender<-ifelse(dataset$gender=="female ","Female",dataset$gender)
dataset$gender<-ifelse(dataset$gender=="male","Male",dataset$gender)
dataset$department<-ifelse(dataset$department=="Research and Development","Research & Development",dataset$department)
```

# First Analysis (London/Barcelona)

Our first analysis is carried out with the aim of
identifying the significant differences between the two
workplaces: Barcelona and London. In order to perform
this analysis in the best possible way, we have divided
the main dataset into two parts: one concerning the
employees in Barcelona and one concerning the employees
in London :

```{r divide data,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
##Divide our dataset into 2 others
dataset_london<-filter(dataset,city=="London")
dataset_barcelona<-filter(dataset,city=="Barcelona")
```

## Education level and field

Thanks to this picture we are able to traduce the
education number into education levels :
![](correspondance.png)

We had to use the "arrange" function because the values
were not sorted by education level, so the result on the
plot was not analysable at all.

With this table we can then interpret this column:
```{r education analysis}
education_combined<-select(dataset,education,education_field)%>%
  arrange(education)
ggplot(education_combined, aes(fill=education, y=education, x=education_field)) + 
  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")+
  labs(x="Field of education", y="Level of education")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust =1, hjust=1))
```

As we can see most of employees did an Life Sciences and
a medical education than Marketing.
Most of them have a 3 or 4 level education, a small
population has a low and high education.



# London/Barcelona analysis
## Mean age

First of all we started with some basics analysis, for example the mini, maxi, mean age in Barcelona and London:

```{r mean age}
summary(dataset_barcelona$age)
summary(dataset_london$age)
```

The age variable is rather similar between Barcelona and
London. The minimum age is the same, the maximum age is
slightly different and the average age is the same
between the two cities. 

## Traveling frequency

We will therefore compare the travel frequencies of the 2 different companies in London and Barcelona.

```{r traveling frequency table, echo=FALSE}
table(dataset_barcelona$business_travel)
table(dataset_london$business_travel)
travel_frequency<-matrix(c("","Non-Travel","Frenquently","Rarely",
                           "Barcelona",(24*100/271),(50*100/271),(197*100/271),
                           "London",(129*100/1201),(224*100/1201),(848*100/1201)),ncol =4,byrow=TRUE)
```

```{r traveling frequency visualisation}
travel_frequency
```

Thanks to the table above, we notice that in general the
percentages of the population according to their
frequency of travel are more or less identical depending
on the city. 

## Distribution of employees in the departments

In this section we will compare the distribution of
employees within the two companies. We will then draw
conclusions on one of the problems of the new CEO
concerning the succession of employees in the different
sectors.

```{r department}

department_barcelona<-ggplot(dataset_barcelona,aes(x=department))+
  geom_bar()+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=0.5, color="black")+
  labs(x="Department in Barcelona")+
theme_light()

department_london<-ggplot(dataset_london,aes(x=department))+
  geom_bar()+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=0.5, color="black")+
    labs(x="Department in London")+
theme_light()
plot_grid(department_barcelona, department_london, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

Analyzing the two graphs, we can see that in Barcelona
there will be a possible succession problem in the HR sector. We are going to make a more detailed
analysis to know the age of the employee in this
area.

```{r HR analysis}
HR<-filter(dataset_barcelona, department=="HR")
HR[1]
```

The only HR employee in Barcelona is 45 years old, not
yet close to retirement but not very young either. It
would be interesting to recruit an additional person in
this area so that he can pass on his knowledge and
subsequently take over the HR area in Barcelona.
